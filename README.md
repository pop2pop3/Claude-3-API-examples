Claude excels at a wide variety of tasks involving language, reasoning, analysis, coding, and more. The models are highly capable, easy to use, and can be customized to suit your needs.
Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus are the next generation of Claude models. They are state-of-the-art text and vision models that can generate human-like text outputs based on both image and text inputs. With powerful vision capabilities, they open up exciting possibilities for computer vision and image understanding applications. Opus, the most powerful model, offers unparalleled intelligence, reasoning, and creativity on a wide range of tasks, while Haiku offers plenty of capability at very high speed and low cost. Sonnet offers a great balance between the two.
